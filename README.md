# Password Complexity Checker

This Python program is a Password Complexity Checker that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to enter a password and check its strength based on predefined complexity rules.

## Features

  - Minimum length (default is 8 characters)
  - Presence of at least one uppercase letter
  - Presence of at least one lowercase letter
  - Presence of at least one digit
  - Presence of at least one special character
- Provides a strength score (from 0 to 5) for the entered password
- Displays a descriptive strength label ("Weak", "Medium", or "Strong") based on the score
- Offers feedback suggestions for improving the password's complexity

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. A GUI window will appear with an input field and a "Check Password" button.
3. Enter your desired password in the input field.
4. Click the "Check Password" button.
5. The program will analyze the password's complexity and display the strength score, strength label, and feedback suggestions in the GUI window.
